<h1>Foxopedia Wiki: Location & Distribution of Foxes</h1>

<p>Foxes tend to be versatile when it comes to where they live.
They can be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, however they have also been found in several regions of Australia.
They are able to live in plains, mountains, deserts, urban areas, and suburban areas.
In the winter, foxes may create dens underground, which is part of their ability to adapt.</p>

<p>It is fairly difficult to estimate the number of foxes that live in a given area, due to their reclusive nature.
This creates difficulty for researches as they attempt to learn more about these creatures.
Foxes live and hunt alone, however they are not aggressive towards eachother, even if their territories overlap.
The only exception is males, who will fight to the death during mating season.</p>
