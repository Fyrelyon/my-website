<p>It is commonly believed that foxes, like many other canids, are carnivores.
This is only half true, however, as foxes are omnivores.
They will eat about anything that is edible.
The diet of foxes is very wide, which allows it to survive in many habitats.</p>

<p>Foxes tend to eat smaller animals, including rodents, rabbits, squirrels, and mice.
They tend to hunt their prey alone, rather than in packs like many canines.
Foxes also feed on berries and fruits depending on the season.
Interestingly, foxes are known to have good memory when finding food.</p>
